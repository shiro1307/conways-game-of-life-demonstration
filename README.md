# Conway’s Game of Life – Interactive Simulation
![2026-02-16 17-03-09](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48c83e1d-a5e0-452c-9bad-51b2fbf2c838)

## Overview

This project is an interactive implementation of Conway’s Game of Life, developed using Lua with the LÖVE2D framework. It provides a dynamic canvas for creating, modifying, and observing cellular automata patterns in real time.

The application supports drawing and erasing cells, stepping through generations manually, and adjusting simulation speed for controlled experimentation.

## Features

- Interactive grid-based canvas  
- Cell drawing and erasing  
- Manual generation stepping  
- Adjustable simulation speed  
- Lightweight custom GUI (`lui.lua`)  

## Technologies Used

- Lua  
- LÖVE2D  
- `lui` (custom lightweight GUI library)  

## Purpose

This project was developed primarily for learning purposes, with the aim of exploring cellular automata concepts and gaining practical experience with Lua and LÖVE2D.

As it was created some time ago, the codebase may not reflect current best practices and is not actively maintained. It is preserved as a reference and demonstration of early experimentation with interactive simulations.
